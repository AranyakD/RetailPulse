# RetailPulse – AI-Powered Customer Analytics & Demand Forecasting

## Overview

RetailPulse is an end-to-end data science project designed to analyze retail transaction data and generate actionable business insights. The system focuses on demand forecasting, customer segmentation, churn prediction, and inventory optimization.

This project simulates a real-world production pipeline, combining data engineering, machine learning, and deployment practices.

## Objectives

* Predict product demand using time-series forecasting
* Segment customers based on behavior (RFM analysis)
* Identify customers at risk of churn
* Optimize inventory decisions using predictive insights
* Build an interactive dashboard for business users
